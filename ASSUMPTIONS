I assumed that anyone can take challenge in guizzes. 
For storing results enough full name of user.
Students can 1 one of 4 options for the answer.
Teacher can add to new quiz unlimited number of questions.
Now teacher is an abstract person.

In future, it is able to make registration system for teachers and for students.
Then teachers will have access not to all quizzes but to thier ones.
(Save to data base author of quiz and creation date)
Also we can make different quantity of options for answers and multi-choise if needed.
I have a lot of ideas.
